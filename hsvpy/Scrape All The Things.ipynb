       "'Don\\'t we all. \\'Petit\\' being a reference to Le Petit Prince, which I only thought about halfway through the sketch Hello, island There\\'s a river flowing through the ocean Blown into prime factors It\\'s commonly known that too much perspective can be a downer. I don\\'t remember her name at all, but she fell asleep on the floor in front of me. They are six-legged spiders Mal, Simon, Wash, Zoe, River, Kaylee, Jayne, Inara, Book. My most famous drawing, and one of the first I did for the site Awww. Poisson distributions have no value over negative numbers They\\'re standing at the lip of the canyon, which isn\\'t clear at all. After reading Slashdot and BoingBoing, sometimes I have to go outside. Just thought you should know I went to a dinner where there was a full 10 minutes of Holy Grail quotes exchanged, with no context, in lieu of conversation.  It depressed me badly. I once made an anniversary card for my then-girlfriend with this layout. Sn = tin I still wish it were true. My brother had a ferret he loved which died since I drew this strip.  RIP. Science joke.  You should probably just move along. A whirlpool! It\\'s depressing how many of these are real shirts I love the idea here, though of course it\\'s not a great-quality drawing or scan. :( That cat has some serious periodic components Disgusting Hell if I know So he\\'s saying that God thought Hitler\\'s art was so bad that the Holocaust was an acceptable alternative.  It\\'s no secret that the hat guy is closely based on Aram, from Men in Hats. Some people haven\\'t heard of the Donner Party.  They were pioneers who got stranded and likely resorted to cannibalism. Too good not to happen. A comic by my brother Doug, redrawn and rewritten by me I think about self-reference a lot.  Example: this comment. This is actually pencil on paper, just inverted and colored I think it\\'s the sheep zapping the cactus and not vice-versa A leading expert characterized the situation as \\'retarded\\' I do this constantly There used to be these ads, see . . . For the moment it\\'s a standoff Like a beacon I don\\'t want to talk about it David did this This was actually drawn years before Red Spiders This one makes me wince every time I think about it There was no alt-text until you moused over I\\'m a big fan of Kurt Halsey I hope we can stop them No more, no less Well, she\\'s pretty hot. Of course, Penny Arcade has already mocked themselves for this.  They don\\'t care. The malaria party was David\\'s idea No two adjacent circles are the same color. The only one of these games I really played was Area 51 Bonus points if you can identify the science in question Even the identity matrix doesn\\'t work normally My first try at drawing a real face in years Opening dialogue by Scott Opening dialogue by Scott Opening dialogue by Scott The Super Bowl is actually an elaborate ruse, concocted by a shadowy group in the mid sixties for this purpose.  The \\'watch it for the ads\\' addition was a master stroke. I bet she gets you to mow the lawn, doesn\\'t she? Love and circuit analysis, hand in hand at last. Just pretend you\\'re kidding. It hurts to be hit there, you know This was an actual mock conversation between me and a friend at TGiF.  The waitress walked up around panel 5 and was somewhat put off. Medium: Pencil on paper Nothing personal, high schoolers. The 8th panel is my favorite Maybe I should\\'ve tried Wexler? And then do it again in a moment now that they\\'re out of Star Power It was tricky. A term coined by my friend Beth A tribute to Buttercup Festival This one is from the Red Belt collection, of \\'medium\\' difficulty. I find so much fun in language. :( I used to do this all the time. The use of the \\'Garfield\\' character for the purposes of this parody qualifies as fair use under the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. sec. 107.  See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music (92-1292), 510 U.S. 569 Of course, you don\\'t wanna limit yourself to the strict forms of the meter.  That could get pretty difficult. It\\'s much better than the other one. There\\'s a red convertible outside my building with the license plate \\'DADS MNY\\'. ... As the King of All Cosmos remarked, \\'Is it that it\\'s fun, or that it lets you forget yourself?\\' She\\'s pretty sharp when provoked. It\\'s true, I think about this all the time. If you\\'re interested in the subject, Lawrence Lessig\\'s \\'Free Culture\\' is pretty good You\\'re probably thinking, \\'has it been a decade?\\'  It\\'s been over thirteen years, buddy. The only downside is that it would be a little uncomfortable She\\'s so fat the attraction goes up as the CUBE of the distance instead of the square We have this conversation at least once a day in my apartment I\\'m sure a discussion of the reason for the disappearance of adventure games in favor of RPGs would be fascinating Sometimes, I sit on top of parking decks and watch the sun rise.  I feel like I should have a guitar or something. Movies that I know word-for-word, part one This one goes out to xxCrazyPixie1987xx Inappropriate places for the Penis Game include baby showers and terrorist attacks I\\'m on the USPS No Fly List This is true.  The lyrics are ridiculous. #pugglewumper Tashari got me some ink pens!  I\\'ve been experimenting with them. i love you This was my friend David\\'s idea I wish I\\'d missed you then so I wouldn\\'t be missing you now He\\'s kind of an asshole, when you think about it It\\'s science! I\\'m like the Terminator, except with love! It\\'s possible.  Better to be on the safe side. I\\'m not sure if this is actually true James suggested this, and I have to agree.  It\\'d be much worse. Once, long ago, I saw this girl go by.  I didn\\'t stop and talk to her, and I\\'ve regretted it ever since. And then it turns out they\\'re both Tyler Durden. Frankly, my dear, I don\\'t give a BITCH ASS SHIT FUCK DAMN ThisadpaidforbythecounciltopromoteMicrosoftandChristianity.  Remember, The Bible is Closed Source. I\\'m just trying to explain, please don\\'t be jealous!  Man, why are all my relationships ruined by early 90\\'s rappers? The graph is of the magnitude of the function with the real value between 0 and 2 and the imaginary between about 35 and 40.  I\\'ve misplaced the exact parameters I used. Chomskyists, generative linguists, and Ryan North, your days are numbered. Gorilla, yes.  Adorable golden retriever, yes.  But it says nothing about meerkats. God, she\\'s such a whore. Following this, the pong paddle went on a mission to destroy Atari headquarters and, due to a mixup, found himself inside the game The Matrix Reloaded.  Boy, was THAT ever hard to explain to him. I woke up to find that I had scrawled the last line of this sleepily on a sheet of paper on my desk.  I shouldn\\'t have listened to the 70\\'s hit marathon on the way home from work the night before. You can just see his dejection as he realizes he\\'s the lead guitar in \\'Hedgeclipper\\' I don\\'t understand why people are so disingenuous!  I just want someone to walk with! So I\\'m a bad person. Romantic comedy heroines, I\\'m talking to you. You spin me right round, baby, right round, in a manner depriving me of an inertial reference frame.  Baby. Edward Tufte\\'s \\'The Visual Display of Quantitative Information\\' is a fantastic book, and should be required reading for anyone in either the sciences or graphic design. There are a lot of books on marketing out there.  I wonder if you\\'re safest just buying the most popular one. Uh-oh. Sometimes when I steer shopping carts around corners, I slide them a little and pretend I\\'m getting the blue spark boost. You laugh to keep from crying, you do math to keep from crying . . . If you think the purveyors of DRM simply want to protect artists, check out chapters 13 and 14 in Free Culture, by Lawrence Lessig.  Their goal is the elimination of all culture they don\\'t control. I found an old tape of this episode in my family\\'s closet.  Check the news section of the forums to see the clip! It\\'s not going to break the fan, bouncing a rubber ball off the wall isn\\'t going to dent it, and the roof can hold me just fine.  You LIED! When Guitar Hero 2 comes out I\\'ll have fresh conversational material for MONTHS. Yes, Eminem is wearing a sleeveless hoodie.  What of it? It\\'s like they got together and said \\'what do we miss most from the internet in 1998?  that\\'s right, embedded MIDI!\\' YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY? This project actually inspired a two-hour powerpoint presentation that Al Gore gave around the country. In Connor\\'s second thesis it is stated \\'There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.\\'  Does the routine destroy our creativity or do we lose creativity and fall into the routine?  Anyway, who\\'s up for a road trip! Every computer, at the unreachable memory address 0x-1, stores a secret.  I found it, and it is that all humans ar-- SEGMENTATION FAULT. Both the skateboards I owned were pretty cheap and broke from heavy use;  I\\'m gonna get a really nice one if I move to the city. I\\'m currently in the I Have Cheese phase of this cycle. I always wanted to impress them with how well I could hear, didn\\'t you?  Also, this sets the record for number of awkward-pause panels in one strip (previously held by Achewood) I just want to give him a hug or something. Although bees with tires would be kinda funny. The robot is pregnant.  It isn\\'t mine. Guys: while I was writing this, I accidentally swallowed a table-sized slab of drywall.  I know!  Wacky. I really shouldn\\'t abuse that power so heavily. Two Hedwig references, an obscure Joey Comeau reference, and a girl with a mohawk.  Yes. My pal Emad does this all the time.  \\'Hey man, which way to the airpart?\\' Proper User Policy apparently means Simon Says. I\\'ve looked into this, and I can\\'t figure out a way to do it cheaply.  And I guess it wouldn\\'t be sanitary. Why would anyone ever, ever say that?  Please, nobody ever say that. Reportedly, double-walled inflatable balls like this exist somewhere.  Now to find that place. If you got a big keyspace, let me search it. Scientists are also sexy, let\\'s not forget that. SomethingAwful has a wonderful compilation of crazy AOL searches in their Weekend Web archives, 2006-08-13. Your IDE\\'s color may vary. Maybe I should let up on Megatokyo a little? But then she does that thing with her tongue and I remember why I left you. And she\\'s gonna feel like a jerk when she realizes it was actually Under Pressure. No one show this to Tycho\\'s wife, okay? As far as treachery-as-driving-music goes, Katamari music is matched only by Guitar Hero music. With reasonable assumptions about latitude and body shape, how much time might she gain them?  Note: whatever the answer, sunrise always comes too soon. (Also, is it worth it if she throws up?) His books were kinda intimidating; rappelling down through his skylight seemed like the best option. There are so many well-meaning conservatives around here who just assume global warming is only presented as a moral issue for political reasons. I\\'m not very good at meeting people. It slowly dawns on us that our parents knew exactly what they were doing. Why can\\'t you have normal existential angst like all the other boys? I\\'m still waiting for a chance to use \\'I have to see a man about a horse\\'. The fifth panel also applies to postmodernists. I hear that these days Bill Watterson is happy just painting in the Ohio woods with his father and doesn\\'t get any mail or talk to anyone. This works on pretty much every level. \\'Arrest me, I\\'m a skateboarder\\' is an even more obnoxious variant. It\\'s like the traveling salesman problem, but the endpoints are different and you can\\'t ask your friends for help because they\\'re sitting three seats down. Yes, I mean she said that during sex.  Yes, it was a little weird. I hope no automatic doors I know read this.  I would be so embarrassed. It\\'s an amazing time of day; the light is great for photography. Yet one more reason I\\'m barred from speaking at crypto conferences. As of this writing, Ubuntu 6.10 and Firefox 2.0 have left my computer a complete mess. I have never been totally satisfied by the explanations for why e to the ix gives a sinusoidal wave. IT\\'S ALL REAL Sometimes I hate the internet.  Sometimes it makes me happy that \\'The Tubes\\' has become slang for the internet so quickly. Maybe someday science will get over its giant collective crush on Richard Feynman.  But I doubt it! I am not making this rule up.  Although my mom wants you all to know it made perfect sense at the time. In fact, draw all your rotational matrices sideways.  Your professors will love it!  And then they\\'ll go home and shrink. It\\'s crazy how much my gut opinion of a movie/song is swayed by what other people say, regardless of how I felt coming out of the theater. If I get a Wii, it will be the first game console I\\'ve owned. When I say we should do something sometime, I\\'m secretly hoping you\\'ll say \\'Why not now?\\' And watch out for that guy from comic #53. I haven\\'t had the patience for RPGs in a long time. For smaller numbers he has to SAVE lives.  The birthrate channel is even more of a mixed bag. zo\\'o ta jitfa .i .e\\'o xu do pendo mi I hear once you\\'ve worked there for 256 days they teach you the secret of levitation. Oh, what a pity, can\\'t you understand . . . The penis varies in size when flaccid and is pretty consistently about yea big when erect.  Anyway, back to the sitcom one-liners and the constant flow of spam. For the IPv6 map just imagine the XP default desktop picture.

It\\'s even harder if you\\'re an asshole who pronounces <> brackets. If you actually do this, what really happens is Douglas Hofstadter appears and talks to you for eight hours about strange loops. The moment their arms spun freely in our air, they were doomed -- for Man has earned his right to hold this planet against all comers, by virtue of occasionally producing someone totally batshit insane. The same goes for the one where you\\'re wrestling the Green Ranger in the swimming pool full of Crisco.  You guys all have that dream, right?  It\\'s not just me.  Right? And 0.002 dollars will NEVER equal 0.002 cents. Like spelling \\'dammit\\' correctly -- with two m\\'s -- it\\'s a troll that works best on the most literate. I\\'m normally a pretty frugal person, but I still compulsively buy any R/C aircraft that\\'s less than $30.  In the last few years, this has become a problem. I\\'ll concede ergonomics anecdotally, but none of the studies of Dvorak were at all rigorous (the most-cited Navy study was overseen by Dvorak himself).  And the \\'slow typists down\\' thing is a myth.  Also EMACS RULES VI DROOLS WOOOOOOO! Police reported three dozen cheerful bystanders, yet no one claims to have seen who did it. I love how Google handles dimensional analysis.  Stats are ballpark and vary wildly by time of day and whether your mom is in town. I hate being the slowest guy in the lab. Let\\'s invite him to a party and play \\'I never\\'.  Okay, I never hid any bodies SOUTH of Main Street. ... he\\'s taking a drink! I actually remember being entertained by both the sequels while in the theater.  They just don\\'t hold up nearly as well in later comparison. Sure, we could stop dictators and pandemics, but we could also make the signs on every damn diagram make sense. But I\\'ve made $13.72 already today!  Ow, stop throwing pennies. Eventually a UN is set up.  And then a lone rebel runs down the line of flags in front of it, runs back to his base, and gets a kajillion points. Somewhere out there is a company that has actually figured out how to enlarge penises, and it\\'s helpless to reach potential customers. If androids someday DO dream of electric sheep, don\\'t forget to declare sheepCount as a long int. This scavenger hunt is getting boring.  Let\\'s go work on the treehouse! They\\'ll pick music and culture that they know annoys you.  Building in behavioral easter eggs is a fair retaliation! Bad flu epidemics can hit young adults hardest because they provoke their powerful immune systems into overreaction, so to stay healthy spend the next few weeks drunk and sleep-deprived to keep yours suppressed. I love Eileen / and want you to love her / When you\\'re around / I\\'m one floor above her / If you could see / just how much I adore her / Oh, that pretty red dress / I\\'d do anything for her /  (Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye ayy) Day six: \\'The hell?  Who mails a bobcat?\\' Great, and you JUST finished paying off the settlement over the Wayne Coyne hamster ball incident. The Hammer + Captain Tightpants == Captain Hammerpants? No, the best things about The Sarah Connor Chronicles were: (1) watching Sarah and Cameron try to pass for normal, and (2) Cameron throwing people and things through walls.  Everything else was pretty secondary. Things are rarely just crazy enough to work, but they\\'re frequently just crazy enough to fail hilariously. It was actually canceled because they just noticed he\\'s been naked under that coat the whole time.  There\\'s a petition on Facebook to get Fox to un-cancel it, and one on Livejournal to get him to take off the coat. It was the funniest 6.5 seconds of my life, although as usual like 80% of it was just Tom and Ray\\'s gasping, hacking laughter. Can\\'t and shouldn\\'t. Forever comparing, never evaluating on any external scale.  If you were a sort function, you\\'d never break the nlogn barrier. Completely implausible? Yes. Nevertheless, worth keeping a can of shark repellent next to the bed. It can\\'t be very MUCH money ... they apparently can\\'t even afford a sampler.  I mean, with a little remixing, some of this could be kinda good! I think I see a Mandelbrot set! No, that\\'s just blood splatters. Golly. You know, pep rallies weirded me out in high school, and they\\'ve only gotten creepier in retrospect. Calling a cab means cutting into beer money. I secretly, deep in my guilty heart, like Papyrus and don\\'t care if it\\'s overused. [Cue hate mail in beautifully-kerned Helvetica.] We have met the enemy and he is us. This happens in geek circles every so often. The \\'Hey, this is just a system I can figure out easily!\\' is also a problem among engineers first diving into the stock market. Wait, is that the ORIGINAL voynich manuscript?  Where did you GET that?  Wanna try playing a round of Druids and Dicotyledons? 413 nanohertz, by the way. Programming the sexbots to enjoy sex seemed a sensible move at the time, but we didn\\'t realize the consequences of their developing fetishes. The G1, especially with the new Android upgrade, is way better than I originally thought. But if you unplug everything, it gets so quiet you hear that high-pitched empty-room hum.  And then the whispers begin. I have a thing for corrupt women. I wonder if I still have time to go shoot a short film with Kevin Bacon. Which is, coincidentally, the most unsettling mantlepiece decoration in my house. Wait, no, that one also loses. How about a nice game of chess? My favorite thing to do at parties is to talk judgmentally about people who aren\\'t there. People aren\\'t going to change, for better or for worse. Technology\\'s going to be so cool. All in all, the future will be okay! Except climate; we fucked that one up. If this were SMBC, the alt-text drawing thingy would be a giraffe hooker fluttering her eyelashes. By the third trimester, there will be hundreds of babies inside you. I remember trying to log in to the original Command and Conquer servers a year or two back and feeling like I was knocking on the boarded-up gates of a ghost town.  If only we\\'d chosen 1944-12-02 08:45:52 as the Unix epoch, we could\\'ve combined two doomsday scenarios into one and added a really boring scene to that Roland Emmerich movie. \\'This space intentionally left blank\\' is less immediately provocative but more Hofstadterially confusing. Cracked.com is another inexplicable browser narcotic.  They could write a list of \\'17 worst haircuts in the Ottoman Empire\\' and I\\'d read through to the end, then click on all the links at the end. Hey, what are the odds -- five Ayn Rand fans on the same train!  Must be going to a convention. Hurricane forums are full of excited comments about central pressure and wind speed and comparisons to Camille and 1931 and 1938, with hastily-tacked-on notes about how it will be tragic if anyone dies and they hope it\\'s a dud. They could say \"the connection is probably lost,\" but it\\'s more fun to do naive time-averaging to give you hope that if you wait around for 1,163 hours, it will finally finish. I wanted us to try finding an approximate numeric solution, but noooo. If you don\\'t have an extension cord I can get that too.  Because we\\'re friends!  Right? Hobby: seeing how many menu selections you can get someone to go through before they realize you\\'re not an automated system and/or hang up. You should talk to the girl down the hall; I think you\\'d like her.  Lemme know if you find out why she\\'s ordering all those colored plastic balls. My biology grad student friends tell me that different types of alcohol don\\'t actually have different effects. I trust their expertise, not because of the \\'biology\\' part, but because of the \\'grad student\\'. My Deep Impact/Little Prince crossover fanfic has been poorly received by the community. I hear many of you finally have smooth Flash support, but me and my Intel card are still waiting on a kernel patch somewhere in the pipeline before we can watch Jon Stewart smoothly. Please do not try any of this and die or get arrested. Stay while I recount the crazy TF2 kill I managed yesterday, my friends. After somewhere around 40 hours, there\\'s no academic reason to go to the class. Only go for the hallucinations. A century later, the harrowing flight of the survivors from Oregon was dramatized in a popular video game. Actually, \\'RSS&M\\' is kinda catchy. You know what really helps an existential crisis? Wondering how much shelf space to leave for a Terry Pratchett collection. YEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHH! \\'Hey Megan, it\\'s your father. How do I print out a flowchart?\\' You can do a lot better than 1% if you start keeping track of the patterns in what numbers people pick. There\\'s Livejournal drama between those who want to wear human suits over fursuits and those who just take off the fursuits. She also starts every letter with \"Dear Future <your name>\". For many of the anatomy pictures on Wikipedia, I think this is actually not far from reality. They only look all formal and professional due to careful cropping. Fine, walk away.  I\\'m gonna go cry into a pint of Ben&Jerry\\'s Brownie Batter(tm) ice cream [link], then take out my frustration on a variety of great flash games from PopCap Games(r) [link]. The 2007 Bridge to Terebithia trailer put me off too much to see that particular movie, but I am cautiously optimistic about Where the Wild Things Are. Well, the kid\\'s definitely getting the biology geek phenotype. Dear Peter Wiggin: This letter is to inform you that you have received enough upvotes on your reddit comments to become president of the world.  Please be at the UN tomorrow at 8:00 sharp.

Let me look away and type \\'guy who\\'s just jealous that I beat all his MarioKart times\\' and turn back, and ... yup, there you are again! I am so excited about the Kepler mission. This is the second most important thing our species has ever done, right behind inventing the concept of delivery pizza. Stephen Douglas actually died soon after the debates and election, but if you demand historical accuracy in your webcomics you should be reading Hark! A Vagrant. The Fujita Scale was replaced by the Enhanced Fujita Scale in 2007, but I think \\'EF-5\\' sounds stupid, so I vote we just use the new measurements for assigning numbers but still call them \\'F-whatever\\'. Asbestos is bad; definitely get the one on the right. Wait -- this one over here has no swine flu!  Now I can\\'t decide. And I even got out my adorable new netbook! More generally, with great power comes great dEnergy/dt. Damn. Not only did he not install it, he sutured a \\'Vista-Ready\\' sticker onto my arm. It looks good, but it needs more postfixins. If the dysentery graph looks historically inaccurate it\\'s because I got all my data from Oregon Trail. I\\'m teaching every 8-year-old relative to say this, and every 14-year-old to do the same thing with Toy Story.  Also, Pokemon hit the US over a decade ago and kids born after Aladdin came out will turn 18 next year. And I could replace you with older pictures of you, from back when you looked happy. I firmly believe that nothing can go wrong on a project if you\\'re wearing one of those wrist things. I mean, seriously, NOWHERE? For starters, there are like a thousand species of dinosaur. A laptop battery contains roughly the stored energy of a hand grenade, and if shorted it ... hey!  You can\\'t arrest me if I prove your rules inconsistent! We live in a world where there are actual fleets of robot assassins patrolling the skies. At some point there, we left the present and entered the future. You think it\\'s so legendarily bad that you\\'ll torrent it and sit through it just for the kitschy nerd cred. I, too, once thought as you did. \\'Cheater!\\' \\'Hey, gaming on wifi? You have only yourself to blame.\\' Where did you even get this wall? Return it there and stand it back up right now. Not enough houses on your block?  Just hit them at 30-year intervals from here to 2300 and get 10x the candy. In the LotR map, up and down correspond LOOSELY to northwest and southeast respectively. Except the people filtering in late are the partiers, so you end up with drunken makeouts in the living room and the next roommate to return home has to sleep in the hall lounge orbital. Dad, where is Grandpa right now? Excellent recovery: ... which we could try to use to somehow save your original brother! I favor approval voting or IRV chiefly because they mean we might get to bring back The Bull Moose party. It may be a fundamentally empty experience, but holy crap the Droid\\'s 265 ppi screen is amazing. They laugh now, but within 10 years the city\\'s entire criminal class will have quit to work on space research. Some engineer out there has solved P=NP and it\\'s locked up in an electric eggbeater calibration routine.  For every 0x5f375a86 we learn about, there are thousands we never see. Moments later, the White Witch rolls up and, confused, tries to tempt the probe with a firmware upgrade. I bet he\\'ll keep quiet for a couple weeks and then-- wait, did you nail a piece of scrap wood to my antique table a moment ago? And from that day on, I wore this little \\'F\\' key pendant everywhere I went. What?  Oh, no, the \\'Enchanted\\' soundtrack was just playing because Pandora\\'s algorithms are terrible.  [silence] ... (quietly) That\\'s how you knooooooow ... The other two are still lost on the infinite plane of uniform density. Wow, that\\'s less than $200 per ... uh ... that\\'s a good deal! Hey, let go! We were all thinking it! Someone had to speak truth to power! An hour later: SUGGESTION: LICK HER NIPPLE MORE. Obligatory bad guy: This operation is sheer foolishness, and it\\'s not happening on my watch!  Mainly because I can\\'t figure out how to adjust the time. On one hand, every single one of my ancestors going back billions of years has managed to figure it out.  On the other hand, that\\'s the mother of all sampling biases. I mean, what\\'s more likely -- that I have uncovered fundamental flaws in this field that no one in it has ever thought about, or that I need to read a little more?  Hint: it\\'s the one that involves less work. If I\\'m such a god, why isn\\'t Maru *my* cat? [Shortly thereafter, at a nearby bakery] ::CRASH:: ::RUMBLE:: ::VRRRRRR:: \\'... I don\\'t know, officer.  It just scooped up an entire rack of scones and drove away!\\' A technology that is \\'20 years away\\' will be 20 years away indefinitely. Physicists who want to protect traditional Christmas realize that the only way to keep from changing Christmas is not to observe it. If you\\'re turning 27 and were born in the Northeast, maybe you were conceived in the April blizzard of 1982. Imagine: snowed in, candles, massage oil, your mom sporting nothing but her early 80\\'s haircut and a smile ... aren\\'t you glad you read the title-text? This doesn\\'t take into account the energy imparted by orbital motion (or gravity assists or the Oberth effect), all of which can make it easier to reach outer planets. Force-choking the chicken. The rat\\'s perturbed; it must sense nanobots! Code grey!  We have a Helvetica scenario! The most brutal way I\\'ve ever seen someone handle this was \\'Oh, you have a girlfriend. Are you going to get married?\\'  \\'I, uh, don\\'t know--\\' \\'Well, do you love her?\\' \\'...\\' \\'Anyway, what were you saying about the movie?\\' The BBC lead was \\'The elusive erogenous zone said to exist in some women may be a myth, say researchers who have hunted for it.\\'  I couldn\\'t read it with a straight face. And every day it gets harder to fight the urge to su to the user and freak people out. Or the pressure at the Earth\\'s core will rise slightly. The contents of any one panel are dependent on the contents of every panel including itself. The graph of panel dependencies is complete and bidirectional, and each node has a loop. The mouseover text has two hundred and forty-two characters. Pool on the roof must\\'ve sprung a leak. I believe the truth always lies halfway between the most extreme claims. That card holds a refrigerator carton\\'s worth of floppy discs, and a soda can full of those cards could hold the entire iTunes store\\'s music library. Mmmm. Sci-fi has energy weapons because otherwise the people like me who watch it get distracted counting shots. I was going to be a scientist, but that seems silly now. Magical worlds exist. I\\'ve learned a huge truth about our place in the universe. I\\'m supposed to care about college? I mean, FUCK. He says this is the year of Linux on the desktop! The world of Windows will fade any moment now! On January 26th, 2274 Mars days into the mission, NASA declared Spirit a \\'stationary research station\\', expected to stay operational for several more months until the dust buildup on its solar panels forces a final shutdown. HOW ABOUT A NICE GAME OF STRIP GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR? Although really, the damage was done when the party planners took the hole punch to the elevator ribbon to hang up the sign. No, YOU stumble past a series of post-breakup hookups in a daze as you slowly realize what you\\'ve lost and how unlikely you are ever to get it back first. Also, it\\'s not like anyone actually calls up the Nobel committee to double-check things. Why do all my attempts at science end with me being punched by Batman?  (P.S. benzoyl peroxide soap works great.) You don\\'t use science to show that you\\'re right, you use science to become right. I suppose that\\'s more accurately a hare dryer. Hey, why do YOU get to be the president of Tautology Clu-- wait, I can guess. You want me to pick up waffle cones? Oh, right, for the wine. One sec, let me just derive your son\\'s credit card number and I\\'ll be on my way. The weird sense of duty really good sysadmins have can border on the sociopathic, but it\\'s nice to know that it stands between the forces of darkness and your cat blog\\'s servers. Sometimes I\\'m terrified to realize how many options other people have. You\\'ll be moved up from 49 of ~7 billion to 31 of ~7 billion. You roll for initiative, and ... [roll] ... wow, do you ever take it. Great, LO-M. Do you speak Bocce? I\\'m supposed to find one that speaks Bocce. The Strong Collatz Conjecture states that this holds for any set of obsessively-hand-applied rules. The reverse only works if the subject has a nervous twitch.

Yes, there are a lot of longing looks across the bridge of Galactica first, but that\\'s beside the point! The typical internet user (who wants to share) has an IQ of 147 and a 9-inch penis. Well, better than the reverse, I guess. We never see any time travelers because they all discover it\\'s a huge mistake. This is also why your friend at the lab suddenly looked about a year older recently. ... go go gadget video camera.  Go go gadget cup. Statistics suggest that there should be tons of alien encounter stories, and in practice there are tons of alien encounter stories. This is known as Fermi\\'s Lack-of-a-Paradox. Hey, it says here that if you dream about your teeth falling out, it means they\\'re spreading. To be fair, the braised and confused newt on a bed of crushed Doritos turned out to be delicious. Also, I apologize for the time I climbed down into your world and everyone freaked out about the lesbian orgy overseen by a priest. This is how I explain computer problems to my cat. My cat usually seems happier than me. The USGS operates a really neat email/SMS earthquake notification service (earthquake.usgs.gov/ens/) that allows fine-grained control of notifications. There\\'s also a Katamari level where everything is just slightly bigger than you, and a Mario level with a star just out of reach. The chemistry experiment had me figuratively -- and then shortly thereafter literally -- glued to my seat. Don\\'t click on the wing. I mean, it\\'s been almost twenty years. Now, it\\'s possible you\\'re simply embedding Windows directory paths in your URIs, but in that case you need more than just a short lecture. Maybe we\\'re all gonna die, but we\\'re gonna die in *really cool ways*. It\\'s a lasing cat-vity! I just caught myself idly trying to work out what that resistor mass would actually be, and realized I had self-nerd-sniped. Telescopes and bathyscaphes and sonar probes of Scottish lakes, Tacoma Narrows bridge collapse explained with abstract phase-space maps, some x-ray slides, a music score, Minard\\'s Napoleonic war: the most exciting new frontier is charting what\\'s already here. We\\'re also stuck with blurry, juddery, slow-panning 24fps movies forever because (thanks to 60fps home video) people associate high framerates with camcorders and cheap sitcoms, and thus think good framerates look \\'fake\\'. In the off-seasons, I hire an animal trainer to help confront secret agents with situations which they are unable to report by radio. Let\\'s get dinner after we promptly destroy all the X-7 we\\'ve manufactured. We once got grounded when we convinced the FAA to block flights through our county because of ash clouds. Three headstones down, I got a call from my mom and it went from bad to worse. I am firmly of the opinion that if something doesn\\'t have a year on it, every time the expiration date rolls around it is good again for the two weeks preceding that date. At one point, by force of childhood habit, the doctor accidentally removed three or four organs. The article has twenty-three citations, one of which is an obscure manuscript from the 1490\\'s and the other twenty-two are arguments on LanguageLog. You fancy me mad. Could a madman have outsmarted the greatest electronica/techno artists of our era? Next to fall will be Roderick Usher\\'s house/trance band. I\\'m looking to virally monetize your eyeballs by selling them for transplants. 100 years later, this story remains terrifying--not because it\\'s the local network block, but because the killer is still on IPv4. The heartfelt tune it plays is CC licensed, and you can get it from my seed on JoinDiaspora.com whenever that project gets going. There\\'s nothing hotter than porn dubbed over with a poorly-mic\\'d teenager\\'s voice explaining each step in a droning monotone. \\'okay, we\\'re almost at the spawn point ... separate the labia, but watch out, there are more inside them ...\" And of course I had to redo this like three times because I kept writing \\'UNTIE\\'; I kept doing \\'doing \\'doing it wrong\\' wrong\\' wrong. All those GTA marathons during the pregnancy were a bad idea. The definitions I grew up with were that a geek is someone unusually into something (so you could have computer geeks, baseball geeks, theater geeks, etc) and nerds are (often awkward) science, math, or computer geeks. But definitions vary. To get serious analyses of hurricanes and oil slicks, see Jeff Masters\\' blog. To get serious discussions of worst-case scenario thinking, see Bruce Schneier\\'s blog. To get enough Vitamin D, don\\'t read any blogs and go outside instead. Volunteers needed for a study on transmission of urushiol from digital contact with thin strips of fibrous cellulose pulp. Of course, since their cautionary tale was reported in a print newspaper, no one read it. Parents: talk to your kids about popup blockers. Also, at some point, sex. But crucial fundamentals first! Oh God, the tornado picked up snakes! Also, if you read his speech at Rice, all his arguments for going to the moon work equally well as arguments for blowing up the moon, sending cloned dinosaurs into space, or constructing a towering penis-shaped obelisk on Mars. The prereqs for CPSC 357, the class on package management, are CPSC 432, CPSC 357, and glibc2.5 or later. Replace the pendulums with history students and you\\'ll qualify for a grant! News networks giving a greater voice to viewers because the social web is so popular are like a chef on the Titanic who, seeing the looming iceberg and fleeing customers, figures ice is the future and starts making snow cones. This is also one of only five identified situations in which a vuvuzela is actually appropriate. If at least one person has a nightmare about being swarmed by hundreds of mouse-sized dromaeosaurids, my work will have been done. Handy exam trick: when you know the answer but not the correct derivation, derive blindly forward from the givens and backward from the answer, and join the chains once the equations start looking similar. Sometimes the graders don\\'t notice the seam. Someone should really bring them a ladder and remind them to build the Endless Stair *first* next time. A breadth-first search makes a lot of sense for dating in general, actually; it suggests dating a bunch of people casually before getting serious, rather than having a series of five-year relationships one after the other. I just call all of them \\'synecdoche\\'. I once worked on a friend\\'s dad\\'s computer. He had the hard drive divided into six partitions, C: through J:, with a \\'Documents\\' directory tree on each one. Each new file appeared to be saved to a partition at random. I knew enough not to ask. Cue letters from anthropology majors complaining that this view of numerolinguistic development perpetuates a widespread myth. They get to write letters like that because when you\\'re not getting a real science degree you have a lot of free time. Zing! Dear editors of Homeopathy Monthly: I have two small corrections for your July issue.  One, it\\'s spelled \"echinacea\", and two, homeopathic medicines are no better than placebos and your entire magazine is a sham. The exact cause of the phenomenon is unknown, but it\\'s thought to be linked to atmospheric refraction and you getting a really cool car. Mr. Rogers projected an air of genuine, unwavering, almost saintly pure-hearted decency. But when you look deeper, at the person behind the image ... that\\'s exactly what you find there, too. He\\'s exactly what he appears to be. College Board issues aside, I have fond memories of TI-BASIC, writing in it a 3D graphing engine and a stock market analyzer. With enough patience, I could make anything ... but friends. (Although with my chatterbot experiments, I certainly tried.) They offered to make me a green beret, but I liked my regular one. Although it gets kind of squashed under my helmet. You know that I\\'ll never leave you. Not as long as she\\'s with someone. The same people who spend their weekends at the Blogger Reenactment Festivals will whine about the anachronisms in historical movies, but no one else will care. I understand you and your team worked hard on this, but when we said to make it more realistic, we meant the graphics. People go to the website because they can\\'t wait for the next alumni magazine, right? What do you mean, you want a campus map? One of our students made one as a CS class project back in \\'01!  You can click to zoom and everything! \\'But you\\'re using that same tactic to try to feel superior to me, too!\\' \\'Sorry, that accusation expires after one use per conversation.\\' She\\'s a perfectly nice lady from a beautiful city, and there\\'s no reason to be mean just because she thinks a quarterback is a river in Egypt. I\\'m not listening to you.  I mean, what does a SQUIRREL know about mental health? I\\'m sure they\\'re a harmful tool of the cosmetics-industrial complex and all, but my goodness do those strips ever work to pull gunk out of your pores. I was shocked, disgusted, and vaguely fascinated by the result. \\'How about a little ... *family growth*?\\'  \\'Dude, that\\'s not until round two.\\' Don\\'t need any, thanks. I have a backscattering fetish. There are two or three songs out there with beeps in the chorus that sound exactly like the clock radio alarm I had in high school, and hearing it makes me think my life since junior year has been a dream I\\'m about to wake up from. They actually started the reversed-text practice in 1977 -- not for ease-of-reading reasons, but because too many people were driving backward down the highway blasting the Star Wars opening theme. It gets worse! You know that wizened old monk with the gypsy wife whose voodoo shop we smash up every day after school? Yes, I understand that the turn is half a mile past the big field, but my GPS knows that, too.  This would be easier if you weren\\'t about to ask me to repeat it all back to you. Sweet unintersecting dreams! Ever notice how the more successful observational comics become, the more their jokes focus on flying and hotels? I\\'m just worried that we\\'ll all leave and you won\\'t get to come along! Normally, the Shuttle can\\'t quite safely reach the orbital inclination required to pass over both those points from a Canaveral launch, but this is an alternate history in which either it launches from Vandenberg or everyone hates the Outer Banks. I learned from Achewood that since this poem is in ballad meter, it can be sung to the tune of Gilligan\\'s Island.  Since then, try as I might, I haven\\'t ONCE been able to read it normally. The tumbleweed then tried to roll off into the sunset, but due to the Old West\\'s placement north of the subtropical ridge, the prevailing winds were in the wrong direction. Which, at one point, led to a study showing that LSD produces no more hallucinations than a placebo. What\\'ll I say -- \"I was staring at some cat vomit when I got the news?\" It\\'ll be hilarious the first few times this happens. If you need some help with the math, let me know, but that should be enough to get you started! Huh? No, I don\\'t need to read your thesis, I can imagine roughly what it says. I\\'ve looked through a few annotated versions of classic books, and it\\'s shocking how much of what\\'s in there is basically pop-culture references totally lost on us now. \\'Dude, wait -- I\\'m not American! So my risk is basically zero!\\' Since the goatee, glasses, and Seltzer & Friedberg DVD collection didn\\'t tip you off, there will be a $20 negligence charge for this service. dpkg: error processing package (--purge): subprocess pre-removal script returned error exit 163: OH_GOD_THEYRE_INSIDE_MY_CLOTHES \\'Fucking ineffable\\' sounds like someone remembering how to do self-censorship halfway through a phrase. \\'Guys?

In MY dream, all the people who grew up loving The Giving Tree paired up with all the students who had weird dreams after reading The Metamorphosis. That one was more confusing. Took me five tries to find the right one, but I managed to salvage our night out--if not the boat--in the end. Best trivia I learned while working on this: \\'Man, Farmville is so huge! Do you realize it\\'s the second-biggest browser-based social-networking-centered farming game in the WORLD?\\' Then you wait for the listener to do a double-take. This is a fun explanation to prepare your kids for; it\\'s common and totally wrong. Good lines include \\'why does the air have to travel on both sides at the same time?\\' and \\'I saw the Wright brothers plane and those wings were curved the same on the top and bottom!\\' The Banach-Tarski theorem was actually first developed by King Solomon, but his gruesome attempts to apply it set back set theory for centuries.

Googling inevitably reveals that my problem is caused by a known bug triggered by doing [the exact combination of things I want to do]. I can fix it, or wait a few years until I don\\'t want that combination of things anymore, using the kitchen timer until then. It\\'s my most ambitious project yet, judging by the amount of guacamole. If you ever hear \"Wait, is that Kim Dotcom\\'s new project?

Thank you for teaching us how big our world is by sharing so many of your own. The invisible hand of the market never texts me back. Due to their proximity across the channel, there\\'s long been tension between North Korea and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Southern Ireland. At the bottom left: The mystery of why, when I know I needed to be asleep an hour ago, I decide it\\'s a good time to read through every Wikipedia article in the categories \\'Out-of-place artifacts\\', \\'Earth mysteries\\', \\'Anomalous weather\\', and \\'List of people who disappeared mysteriously\\'. Since it sounds like your time spent typing can\\'t possibly be less productive than your time spent not typing, have you tried typing SLOWER? [Halfway to the Sun ...] Heyyyy ... what if this BALLOON is full of acorns?! We all remember those famous first words spoken by an astronaut on the surface of Mars: \"That\\'s one small step fo- HOLY SHIT LOOK OUT IT\\'S GOT SOME KIND OF DRILL! Get back to the ...

Somewhere in the New Mexico desert, the Roadrunner is pursued by a tireless Anton Chigurh. \"Mr. President, what if the unthinkable happens? What if the launch goes wrong, and Napoleon is not stranded on the Moon?\" \"Have Safire write up a speech.\" Haha, you\\'ll see! If you live in the Northern hemisphere, anyway. In the southern hemisphere, due to the coriolis effect, babies are born nine months BEFORE they\\'re conceived. I honestly didn\\'t think you could even USE emoji in variable names. Or that there were so many different crying ones. The flood of PermaCalNTP leap-second notifications was bad enough, but when people started asking for millisecond resolution, the resulting DDOS brought down the internet. How many points do you get for dunking every basketball in existence at once? This would be bad enough, but every 30th or 40th pokÃ©ball has TWO of them inside. Although right now I\\'m more excited about ESPRESSO\\'s radial velocity measurements, so I\\'m listening to This Kiss, her song about measuring \"centrifugal motion\" on \"a rooftop under the sky\". Hang on, I\\'ve heard this problem. We need to pour water into the duct until the phone floats up and ... wait, phones sink in water. Mercury. We need a vat of mercury to pour down the vent. That will definitely make this situation better and not worse. The sudden introduction of Venusian flowers led to an explosive growth of unusual Earth pollinators, which became known as the \"butterfly effect.\" I\\'M SORRY, FROM YOUR YEARS OF CONDESCENDING TOWARD THE \\'SQUISHY SCIENCES\\', I ASSUMED YOU\\'D BE A LITTLE HARDER. That seems like an awful lot of hassle when all I wanted was a cool sword. Astrobiology is held back by the fact that we\\'re all too nervous to try to balance on the ladder while holding an expensive microscope. Oh, weird, Amazon is out of butterfly nets. I would say time is definitely one of my top three favorite dimensions.  They work even better if you take them with our experimental placebo booster, which I keep in the same bottle. At this point, if we\\'re going to keep insisting on portraying dinosaurs as featherless because it\\'s \"cooler\", it\\'s time to apply that same logic to art involving bald eagles. Or whatever\\'s handy! I\\'m pretty much pure alcohol and water, so it doesn\\'t really matter! I\\'m staring at the \"doctor\" section, and I can\\'t help but feel like I\\'ve forgotten someone.

Neither a spokesperson for the organization nor the current world champion could be reached for comment. Given the role they play in every process in my body, really, they deserve this award more than me. Just gotta figure out how to give it to them. Maybe I can cut it into pieces to make it easier to swallow ... Otherwise known as Margaret the Destroyer, I will bring pain to the the Great One. Then again, maybe I won\\'t.

The Lord of the Rings sequel, set years after the Ring hubbub has died down, is just Samwise discreetly creeping back to Bag End to finish dropping the eaves. After decades of increasingly confused arguing, Pluto is reclassified as a \"dwarf Pluto.\" It\\'s definitely an intentional foul, but we\\'ve decided it\\'s worth it. I guess I should be signing stuff, but I\\'ve never been sure what to sign. Maybe if I post my private key, I can crowdsource my decisions about what to sign. The Earth\\'s five major mass extinctions were the Posh Extinction, the Sporty Extinction, the Scary Extinction, the Ginger Extinction, and the Baby Extinction. I\\'m going to drive this Netherlands joke so far into the ground they\\'ll have to build levees around it to keep the sea out. The other half has some cool shipwrecks, rocks, and snakes, but if you move those out of the way, it also has more sky. And on the pedestal these words appear: \"And on the pedestal these words appear: \"And on the pedestal these words appear: \"And ... It\\'s probably for the best. Since Roombas are native to North America, it\\'s illegal for Americans to keep them in their houses under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

There\\'s no \"I\" in \"VOWELS\". Fans eagerly await 2015\\'s \\'Space Fights: Power Gets Up\\', although most think 1999\\'s \\'Space Fights: The Scary Ghost\\' didn\\'t live up to the hype. Every few months, I think about sex every seven seconds and how weird and implausible it would be. Hang on, let me scare the live raccoon over to the same side as the dead one. Yes, it took a lot of work to make the cards and pieces, but it\\'s worth it--the players are way more thorough than the tax prep people ever were. Household tip: Tired of buying so much toilet paper? Try unspooling the paper from the roll before using it. A single roll can last for multiple days that way, and it\\'s much easier on your plumbing.

Since people rarely try to cut down cell phone towers, after millions of years, as cell phone towers have gotten more treelike, trees have started growing fake cell phone tower attachments and shiny gray bark to protect themselves. This is a standard textbook example of convergent evolution. The less common, even worse outcome: \"3: [everyone in the financial system] WOW, where did all my money just go?\" CLIMAX is good, but SEXCLIMAX is even better. The xkcd Survey: Big Data for a Big Planet We had gathered that raw information, but had yet to put it all together. Careful mathematical analysis demonstrates small-scale irregularities in Gaussian distribution \"There\\'s one set of foot-p\\'s cause I was totes carrying you, bro!\" said Jesus seconds before I punched him. I literally could care less. The few dozen doors that have little Christmas trees on them are a nice touch. After a while, the squirrel starts making that beeping noise and doesn\\'t stop until it hops back up onto the stump. And when I think about it, a lot of \"things I want to do\" are just learning about and discussing new tools for tinkering with the chain. And a different ghost has replaced me in the bedroom. I guess I need to apologize to my parents, friends, and the staff at Chuck E. Cheese\\'s for all the times I called the cops on them. Wait, I can fix this. Picture another field. In the middle sits the only creature the first creature is afraid of. Now just-- wait, where did THAT one go? Why are we spending billions to ruin Mars with swarms of robots when Elon Musk has promised to ruin Mars for a FRACTION of the cost? Charles, I just talked to John and Mildred, who run that company selling seeds and nuts, and their kids with MOUTHS are starving! I just came from The Martian, and I just have to say: Forget BB-8; I want a pet Sojourner! It\\'s always been the cutest of our Mars rovers. In the future, a group of resistance fighters send me back in time with instructions to find the Skynet prototype and try to upgrade it. I won\\'t eat invertebrates, because I can fight a skeleton, but I have no idea what kind of spooky warrior a squid leaves behind. My MRI research shows a clear correlation between the size of the parietal lobe--the part of the brain that handles spatial reasoning--and enjoyment of 3D DoritosÂ®. \"Wait, so in this version is Frankenstein also the doctor\\'s name?\" \"No, he\\'s just \\'The Doctor\\'.\" Why did we even have that thing? The no-communication theorem states that no communication about the no-communication theorem can clear up the misunderstanding quickly enough to allow faster-than-light signaling. On the other hand, it took us embarrassingly long to clue in to the lung cancer/cigarette thing, so I guess the real lesson is \"figuring out which ideas are true is hard.\" The thrower started hitting the bats too much, so the king of the game told him to leave and brought out another thrower from thrower jail. After meeting with a few of the subjects, the IRB actually recommended that you stop stressing out so much about safety guidelines. There\\'s a cool mental calculation hack I recently learned for this: If you open the calendar app on your phone or computer, the highest-numbered box along the bottom is equal to the number of days in the month! Visual checks suggest the cool bird has exited the launch zone. Tip the rocket sideways and resume the countdown--we\\'re gonna go find it! If that doesn\\'t fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of \\'It\\'s really pretty simple, just think of branches as...\\' and eventually you\\'ll learn the commands that will fix everything. My hobby: Taking advantage of the rice myth by posting articles on \"how to save your wet phone\" which are actually just elaborate recipes for rice pilaf.

Today\\'s quantum hyper-beings are too busy with their internal multiverse sims to even notice that they\\'re in boxes at all! If that\\'s too easy, you could try joining Tautology Club, which meets on the date of the Tautology Club meeting. Due to a typo, I initially found a forum for serious Fleshlight enthusiasts, and it turns out their highest-end models are ALSO capable of setting trees on fire. They\\'re impossible to use without severe burns, but some of them swear it\\'s worth it. The last band of color indicates the snake\\'s tolerance for being held before biting. Researchers just found the gene responsible for mistakenly thinking we\\'ve found the gene for specific things. It\\'s the region between the start and the end of every chromosome, plus a few segments in our mitochondria. You know what they say--if you don\\'t like the weather here in the Solar System, just wait five billion years. Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy called the man\\'s arguments that he could be either Alito or Ginsburg \"surprisingly compelling, but ultimately unconvincing.\" Return to the play area If anyone tries this on you, the best reply is a deadpan \"Oh yeah, that\\'s a common potato chip flavor in Canada.\" Here in the entomology department, we have a simple two-step formula for answering any question: (1) ants are cool, and (2) we forgot the question because we were thinking about ants. Sure, it may not meet science fair standards, but I want credit for getting my baking soda and vinegar mountain added to the Decade Volcanoes list. The contagious period ends right around when you start to sound sick over the phone, which is probably evidence of cold viruses evolving to spread optimally in the workplace. In ordering #5, self-driving cars will happily drive you around, but if you tell them to drive to a car dealership, they just lock the doors and politely ask how long humans take to starve to death. [Dog returns with the end of a string in its mouth] [Voice drifts down from the sky] Kites are fun! That guy only drives an alkaline car to overcompensate for his highly acidic penis.

Want to feel old? Wait. Within a few minutes, our roads will be full of uncontrollably-swerving cars and our skies full of Amazon delivery dogs. It took a lot of booster rockets, but luckily Amazon had recently built thousands of them to bring Amazon Prime same-day delivery to the Moon colony. It also occasionally replies with \\'Comment of the year\\', \\'Are you for real\\', and \\'I\\'m taking a screenshot so I can remember this moment forever\\'.

(If you include Alaska and Hawaii, you should swap the Aleutian Islands with the Hawaiian ones.) The failures usually don\\'t hurt anything, and if it installs several versions, it increases the chance that one of them is right. (Note: The \\'yes\\' command and \\'2>/dev/null\\' are recommended additions.) After a power outage at the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the new Digital Doomsday Clock is flashing 00:00 and mushroom clouds keep appearing and then retracting once a second. You can also try \\'Yikes.\\' I looked up \"insanity\" in like 10 different dictionaries and none of them said anything like that. Neither did the DSM-4. But I\\'ll keep looking.

I don\\'t think the Lakeshore Air Crash Museum really belongs under \\'Tourist Attractions.\\' It\\'s not a museum--it\\'s just an area near the Lake Festival Laser Show where a lot of planes have crashed. I just spent 20 minutes deciding whether to start an email with \\'Hi\\' or \\'Hey\\', so I think it transferred correctly. There was a schism in 2007, when a sect advocating OpenOffice created a fork of Sunday.xlsx and maintained it independently for several months. The efforts to reconcile the conflicting schedules led to the reinvention, within the cells of the spreadsheet, of modern version control. I figured that now that society has collapsed, I wouldn\\'t need to wear clothes anymore, but apparently that violates some weird rule of quantum gravity. No, a hydroplane doesn\\'t land on water--that\\'s an aquaplane. A hydroplane is a plane that gets electric power from an onboard water reservoir with a tiny dam and turbines. The laws of physics are fun to try to understand, but as an organism with incredibly delicate eyes who evolved in a world full of sharp objects, I have an awful lot of trust in biology\\'s calibration of my flinch reflex. Learning arcane bullshit from the 80s can break your computer, but if you\\'re willing to wade through arcane bullshit from programmers in the 90s and 2000s, you can break everyone else\\'s computers, too. I get that there are security reasons for the schedule, but this is like the ONE problem we have where the right answer is both easy and straightforward. If we can\\'t figure it out, maybe we should just give up and just replace all the portraits on the bills with that weird pyramid eye thing. I\\'ll be honest--the 1950s were a rough time for cycling.

Lambda calculus? More like SHAMbda calculus, amirite? These pranks happen all the time. English doesn\\'t allow one-syllable words to end in a lax vowel, so writers on The Simpsons decided to mess with future linguists by introducing the word \"meh.\" TinyURL was the most popular link shortener for long enough that it made it into a lot of printed publications.

Is that right?\" \"... yes. Yes, exactly.\" Evolutionarily speaking, mushrooms are technically a type of ghost. I got to check off \\'Make something called xkcd\\' early. That\\'s actually the original Japanese version of A Million Random Digits, which is much better than the American remake the book was based on. But instead of hitting the ocean, you should land in an overheating hot tub on a sinking cruise ship, sending it crashing through the floor into the burning engine room as the ship goes under. \"Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty--\" / \"Can\\'t we just read Pat the Bunny?\" It\\'s a myth that you can never cross mountains safely, but be sure you understand how the climatic situation there will affect your parent thunderstorm. Lot of drama in those days, including constant efforts to force the \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\" guy into retirement so we could stop being so paranoid about compilers. We can do this.

Certified skydiving instructors know way more about safely falling from planes than I do, and are way more likely to die that way. I bet if I yell at my scared friends I will feel better. Later, when I remember that I\\'m calling movers, I frantically scribble over the labels and write \\'NORMAL HOUSE STUFF\\' on all of them, which actually makes things worse.

Of course, \"Number of times I\\'ve gotten to make a decision twice to know for sure how it would have turned out\" is still at 0. If anyone calls you on any weird detail, just say it\\'s from the Jedi Prince book series, which contains so much random incongruous stuff that even most Expanded Universe/Legends fans collectively agreed to forget about it decades ago.

This map preserves the shapes of Tissot\\'s indicatrices pretty well, as long as you draw them in before running the resize. Further out to the right, it works correctly, but the reason it works still involves the word \\'firmware.\\' Plus, time\\'s all weird in there, so most of it probably broke down and decomposed hundreds of years ago. Which reminds me, I\\'ve been meaning to get in touch with Yucca Mountain to see if they\\'re interested in a partnership. Dvorak words may sound hard to pronounce, but studies show they actually put less stress on the vocal cords.

Google and Yelp keep deleting my scathing reviews of the Mariana Trench, the Chernobyl reactor core, the jet stream, and the equator. \"So, like, sexy news videos?\" \"No, people have tried that--it\\'s still just video content. We need to actually inform people THROUGH making out.
